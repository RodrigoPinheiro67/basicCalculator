# Basic Calculator in Go with unit test

## Description

>This project consists of a basic calculator written in Go, capable of performing simple mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The division function includes error handling for cases of division by zero.

## Available Functions

* Add(a, b float64): Returns the sum of two numbers.
* Subtract(a, b float64): Returns the difference between two numbers.
* Multiply(a, b float64): Returns the product of two numbers.
* Divide(a, b float64): Returns the quotient of two numbers and an error if the divisor is zero.

## Tests
* The project includes unit tests to validate each of the mathematical operations. The tests check for the accuracy of calculations and the correct handling of errors in zero division.

## Usage
* To run the main program that tests the calculator's functions, use the command go run main.go. To execute the tests, use the command go test.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical example to understand how to create and test a simple set of mathematical functions in Go.
